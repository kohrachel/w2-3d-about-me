# 3d About Me (it's a desk)

Every week, [@zineanteoh](https://github.com/zineanteoh) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.

This is my project for week 2. It's a 3d scene that was supposed to look like Lofi Girl's room, but I realized that 3D graphics is hard. So... I just made a desk. That tells you a lot about me.

Built with Three.js.

Total time taken: 2 hours (and a lot of scream-debugging)

Techstack/technologies used:

- Three.js
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
